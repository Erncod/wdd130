            Hello! My name is Eze Ernest Tobechukwu. I am passionate about education, science, and technology.
            With a background in chemistry, nutrition, and software development, I enjoy combining creativity
            and problem-solving to build meaningful solutions. I also run a technology company that develops
            websites, mobile apps, and desktop software. Outside of work, I love learning new skills,
            designing, and exploring opportunities for growth around the world.
